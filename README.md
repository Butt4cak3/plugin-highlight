This repository contains a custom version of plugin-highlight for the
[Arcane Algorithm Archive](https://algorithm-archivists.github.io/). The only
change so far is that it utilizes our custom version of highlight.js. If you
want to use plugin-highlight for your own project, then you should probably use
the official version or find a fork that's being actively maintained.
